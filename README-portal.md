# Permanence Mod for Factorio

Never remove anything. What could go wrong? This mod makes all placed objects non-removable. The ultimate Factorio hard mode!
Good luck >:D

## Use in existing worlds
When added to an existing world, all objects that are newly placed are made non-removable. All objects placed before the mod was present are still removable.

## sudo remove
There is still a way to remove some objects, if you really want to. Just point your machine gun at them and start shooting. Or if you like having fun drop a few nukes on your old factory. Of course this will not return any resources.
